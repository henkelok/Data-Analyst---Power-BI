CODIVY CONSULTING'S DATA ANALYTIC INTERNSHIP PROGRAM

TASK:
Data Analysis focuses on leveraging Power BI to enhance data visualization and analytical capabilities.

1. Monthly Crude Oil Production Trends:
Use Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes monthly crude oil production trends over the last ten years. 
Ensure the dashboard allows for drill-down capabilities to view trends by year and month.

2. LPG Imports and Exports Comparison:
Create a comparative analysis of LPG imports and exports by country and year using Power BI. 
Include visualizations that highlight the top importing and exporting countries, and provide insights into significant trends.
